## Capturing output manually

While nlrx provides the `metrics`, `metrics.turtles`, `metrics.patches` and `metrics.links` slots of the `exerpiment` class to capture global and agent related output from NetLogo models, this might not be sufficient under certain circumstances. For example, the `metrics` slot cannot track and collect nested list output or similar complex data structures such as NetLogo arrays or matrices. Another example would be spatial output such as shapefiles or grids, generated with the GIS extension. Additionally, you might already have implemented complex routines in your model which write model output to disk.

The main question for this vignette to answer is: How can you link such self-written output to your nlrx experiment. Here we show you one basic example how this works. In this example we write ascii raster files using the GIS extension in NetLogo. However, the same workflow can of course be applied to other types of output, for example text files written with `file-type` primitives or the csv extension.


#### Step 1: Creating an ID widget on your model interface

In order to link self-written output to our nlrx simulations within the R session, we need to transfer the current nlrx siminputrow and seed to our NetLogo model. That way, when executing `run_nl_all()`, within each simulation the NetLogo model exactly "knows" which parameter row (siminputrow) is currently simulated and the corresponding random seed. To transfer this information we just need to create a string input widget on our model interface. In the example below, we created such a widget at the bottom of the Wolf Sheep model called `nlrx_id`.

#### Step 2: Define idrunnum of the experiment

The idrunnum field of the experiment is a built-in feature that allows to transfer the current experiment name, siminputrow and random seed to a defined NetLogo gui parameter widget.
In our case we want to use our newly created `nlrx_id` string input field, so we just set `idrunnum = nlrx_id`.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# Attach experiment
nl@experiment <- experiment(expname="wolf-sheep",
                            outpath=outpath,
                            repetition=1,
                            tickmetrics="true",
                            idsetup="setup",
                            idgo="go",
                            idrunnum="nlrx_id",
                            runtime=50,
                            evalticks=seq(40,50),
                            metrics=c("count sheep"),
                            variables = list('initial-number-sheep' = list(min=50, max=150, qfun="qunif"),
                                             'initial-number-wolves' = list(min=50, max=150, qfun="qunif")),
                            constants = list("model-version" = "\"sheep-wolves-grass\"",
                                             "grass-regrowth-time" = 30,
                                             "sheep-gain-from-food" = 4,
                                             "wolf-gain-from-food" = 20,
                                             "sheep-reproduce" = 4,
                                             "wolf-reproduce" = 5,
                                             "show-energy?" = "false"))
```


#### Step 3: Use nlrx_id within NetLogo model to tag self-written output

We can now use the `nlrx_id` field within the NetLogo model to tag our self-written output.
One way to do this is to tag the filenames of self-written output. Here is an example where raster grids are created and written at the end of each model run:

```{netlogo eval=FALSE}
to write_final_landscape
  let filename (word nlrx_id "_" but-first (word (1000 + ticks)) ".asc")
  if (file-exists? filename) [file-delete filename]
  gis:store-dataset final_landscape filename  
end
```

Here, we first create our filename by using the string from the `nlrx_id` field (which contains the current experiment name, siminputrow and random seed divided by an underscore) and add the current tick (containing leading zeros by adding 1000 to the tick count and removing the first number afterwards).

Of course you could also use different approaches to utilize the information within the `nlrx_id` field for tagging your output.


#### Step 4: Linking self-written output to nlrx collected output

Finally, we want to read in our self-written raster files, calculate some landscape metrics and add those to the results table that we received from the `run_nl_all()` function.

We basically have two types of output now: The tibble from our model executions, and a folder with self-written output (here defined as a subfolder of our modelpath).

```{r eval=FALSE}
## Output from nlrx simulations:
results <- run_nl_all(nl)
## Self-writte output directory:
ascdir <- file.path(dirname(nl@modelpath), "output")
``` 

We can now loop over the files in that folder, read the content and use the `strplit` function on the filename to identify the experiment name, the siminputrow, the random seed and the tick count. As an example application, we then calculate some landscapemetrics using the `landscapemetrics` package. Finally we put everything into a results tibble:

```{r eval=FALSE}
results.lsm <- purrr::map_dfr(list.files(ascdir, pattern = "asc", full.names = TRUE), function(x) {
  x.split <- strsplit(x, "_")[[1]]
  x.tick <- as.numeric(strsplit(x.split[[length(x.split)]], "\\.")[[1]][[1]])
  x.siminputrow <- as.numeric(x.split[[length(x.split) - 1]][[1]])
  x.seed <- as.numeric(x.split[[length(x.split) - 2]][[1]])
  x.raster <- raster(x)
  
  ## netlogo asc files use NaN as default nodata value in the asc file header
  ## this leads to problems when reading the raster because it sets Â´zeros to NA
  ## here we set NAs back to zertos manually:
  x.raster <- reclassify(x.raster, cbind(NA, 0))
  
  ## Calculate landscape metrics:
  metrics <- c("lsm_l_ed", "lsm_l_shdi", "lsm_l_lsi", "lsm_l_lpi", "lsm_l_area_mn")
  x.metrics <- landscapemetrics::calculate_lsm(x.raster, what=metrics) %>% 
    dplyr::select(metric, value) %>% 
    tidyr::pivot_wider(names_from=metric, values_from = value)
  
  x.final <- tibble::tibble(siminputrow = x.siminputrow,
                            `[step]` = x.tick,
                            `random-seed` = x.seed)
  
  x.final <- cbind(x.final, x.metrics)
  return(x.final)
})
```

Now we have the same identifier columns in the nlrx reported output and the self-written output tibble which allows us to join both tibbles together:

```{r eval=FALSE}
## Combine results with lsm and store:
results <- results %>% left_join(results.lsm, by = c("siminputrow", "random-seed", "[step]"))

## Attach output to nl object:
setsim(nl, "simoutput") <- results
saveRDS(nl, file = file.path(outpath, "my_final_nl_object.rds"))
```
