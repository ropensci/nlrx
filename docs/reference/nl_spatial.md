# Wolf Sheep model sample data: spatial

The dataset contains a complete nl object. The nl object has been used
to setup and run a simple simulation design. For these simulations,
spatial agent output has been collected. metrics.turtles was set up to
measure turtle coordinates. metrics.patches was set up to measure colors
of cells. It also contains the model outputs within the simdesign
object.
