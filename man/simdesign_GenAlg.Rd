\description{
Add a Genetic Algorithm simdesign to a nl object
}
\details{
This function creates a simdesign S4 class which can be added to a nl object by using the setter function simdesign(nl).
The GenAlg simdesign generates a Genetic Algorithm experiment within the defined min and max parameter boundaries
that are defined in the variables field of the experiment object within the nl object.
The evalcrit reporter defines the evaluation criterion for the simulated annealing procedure.
The reporter is defined within the experiment metrics vector.
For the Genetic Algorithm function we only refer to the position of the reporter that we want to use for evaluation.
The function uses the genalg package to set up a Genetic Algorithm function.
For details on the genalg function parameters see ?genalg::rbga
Finally, the function reports a simdesign object.
